### Decentralized Skill-Backed Certificate Verification System

CampusCert is a **Web3-based platform** that enables campuses and organizers to issue **tamper-proof, instantly verifiable certificates** as NFTs. Students receive lifelong ownership of credentials, while recruiters and institutions can verify authenticity and skills **on-chain in seconds**.

## 🏆 Why CampusCert? (Problem)

Campus certificates today are:
- ❌ Centralized and unverifiable  
- ❌ Easy to forge or duplicate  
- ❌ Manually verified (slow & unreliable)  
- ❌ Lost after graduation  

This creates trust issues during **internships, placements, and higher studies**.
